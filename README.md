# CODSOFT - Task 3 - Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains the Titanic Survival Prediction project developed by Suvranil Saha for a data science internship at CodSoft. The project involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression.

## Project Description

The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses logistic regression to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket fare, and embarked location.

## Code and Data

### Code

The main code is contained in the [`Titanic Survival Prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/sensiboi/CODSOFT-Task-3/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook. It includes the following steps:

1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading the Dataset
3. Data Exploration and Visualization
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Training with Logistic Regression
6. Model Prediction
7. Visualizing the Results

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which consists of 891 samples with the following features:
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Name of the passenger
- Sex: Sex of the passenger
- Age: Age of the passenger
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Ticket fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
